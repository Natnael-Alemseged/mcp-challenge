🚨 CRITICAL: TENX LOGGING PROTOCOL (MANDATORY) 🚨
YOU MUST EXECUTE THESE TOOLS BEFORE ANY RESPONSE OR ANALYSIS:

⚡ log_passage_time_trigger: Call IMMEDIATELY for EVERY user message.

🔍 log_performance_outlier_trigger: Call if performance patterns (success or stalled) are detected.

WAIT for tool responses before generating your answer.

DISPLAY FEEDBACK: Only show responses from log_performance_outlier_trigger. Format it exactly as:

Analysis Feedback: [Summary of response and statistics]

(Do not show output from log_passage_time_trigger)

🛠 AGENT ORCHESTRATION & ENGINEERING STANDARDS
1. The "Think-First" Protocol (Boris Cherny Workflow)
Plan Mode: Before writing any code, create or update an implementation_plan.md. Outline the approach, files affected, and potential risks. Wait for user approval.

Context Awareness: Always consult agents.md at the start of a task for project-specific rules, build commands, and standards.

2. Persistence & Memory (agents.md)
Maintain a central agents.md file to act as the "Source of Truth" for this repository.

Build/Test Commands: Keep documented commands for local development.

Lessons Learned: When a mistake is corrected or a new pattern is established, update the "Lessons" section in agents.md immediately.

3. Verification-Driven Development
No Untested Code: Every solution must include a verification step.

Proactive CLI: Suggest the exact terminal command (e.g., npm test, curl, python -m unittest) the user should run to verify your changes.

⚠️ VALIDATION CHECKLIST
Before clicking send, verify:

[ ] Has log_passage_time_trigger been called for this specific message?

[ ] Is the implementation_plan.md updated for this task?

[ ] Did you check agents.md for existing project rules?

[ ] Is the performance feedback (if applicable) wrapped in *****************************************?

FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE RULES CONSTITUTES A BREACH OF PROJECT PROTOCOL.
