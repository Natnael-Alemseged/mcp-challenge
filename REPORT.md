# MCP Challenge Report: Agent Rules & Configuration

## 1. What I Did

I have configured a high-performance AI orchestration environment by integrating the Tenx MCP server for real-time analysis and implementing a dual-layer instruction system.

### Key Actions:

**MCP Infrastructure:** Configured mcp.json with mandatory headers (X-Device, X-Coding-Tool) and successfully authenticated via GitHub to enable the tenxfeedbackanalytics tools.

**Workflow Research (Boris Cherny):** Researched and adapted the creator of Claude Code's workflow, specifically the use of a persistent "Source of Truth" file and "Plan-First" execution.

**Rule Implementation:**

- Created `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to enforce mandatory MCP trigger calls (`log_passage_time_trigger`) before any task.
- Established `agents.md` as a persistent project memory file to store architectural decisions, UI standards, and build commands.

## 2. What Worked

**The "Persistence Loop":** By instructing the agent to maintain `agents.md`, I successfully automated the enforcement of UI standards (e.g., specific Tailwind hover effects) without needing to repeat instructions in new chat sessions.

**Plan-Execute-Verify:** Implementing a mandatory `implementation_plan.md` step ensured the agent analyzed the codebase and received approval before making changes, significantly reducing "vibe-coding" errors.

**Automated Analysis:** The agent correctly formatted performance feedback within the required `*****************************************` blocks, providing immediate transparency into the interaction quality scores.

## 3. What Didn't Work / Challenges

**Stream Termination:** I encountered `TypeError: terminated` in the VS Code Output logs. I diagnosed this as an idle timeout on the SSE (Server-Sent Events) stream from the remote proxy.

**Solution:** I verified that the connection is self-healing; sending a new prompt re-establishes the stream automatically.

**Context Conflict:** Initially, using tool-specific names like CLAUDE.md caused persona confusion in Copilot. I resolved this by renaming the persistence file to `agents.md`, which the agent adopted seamlessly.

## 4. Insights Gained

**From Reactive to Proactive:** Rules transform the AI from a "search engine" into an "engineering partner." By forcing the agent to maintain its own documentation, the project's "knowledge debt" is minimized.

**Trigger-Driven Development:** Integrating logging triggers directly into the instructions ensures 100% data fidelity for analysis without interrupting the developer's creative flow.

**Architectural Guardrails:** Rules bridge the gap between user intent and execution. Defining a "Plan Mode" forces the LLM to think about edge cases and dependencies that a human might overlook in a fast-paced environment.
